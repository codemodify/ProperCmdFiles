This removes Adobe Flash from windows completely.
The WHY: if you run the flash uninstaller provided by Adobe it does it "superficially".
You will still see flash running in Skype for example and other "services" that track 
and sell ads throughout the windows.

Run it and contribute to the end of the "CrapWare" by the behemots.
